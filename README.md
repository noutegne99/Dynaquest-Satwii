Abstract: Reported dynamic multi-satellite scheduling approaches for Earth observations show many limitations when operating in time-varying uncertain environment. They largely run over predetermined time periods and often offline, assume negligible execution time, improperly account for the passage of time during planning, remain myopic or fail to show “anytime” behavior. A novel approach to solving the dynamic multi-satellite scheduling problem is proposed. The open-loop with feedback DynaQUEST approach includes an event-driven controller monitoring dynamic situation evolution while supervising a co-evolving episodic scheduling problem solver. Reactive to real-time and delayed information feedback, the controller timely enables the problem-solver to stay responsive, interruptible and adaptive, taking advantage of emerging opportunities to timely improve solution quality. The problem-solver continually solves a new static problem shaped by dynamic changes and constrained by current resource c (More)
